running the lapw codes from Dr.Papa
===========================
These scripts stitch together the different lapw codes.

It's important to make sure the CDN1 and INFILEs in 
lat_src are set up correctly for the correct combination.

run.lapw.lat works for a single lattice constant
run.lapw.multi works for range of lattice constants,
running them simultaneously 
run.lapw.seq works for a range of lattice constants
but in sequence.

The range and step size of the lattice constants can be 
modified.

To run, after correcting the lat_src files, first set the 
lattice constant values to calculate in run.lapw.multi
then: ./run.lapw.multi > &log& 

The energyfit directory has the scripts necessary to
calculate the energies and pressure fit to smaller 
lattice constants for a smoother plot. Set the path to the 
calculated lattice points in the file "energyfit" and run as:
./energyfit
